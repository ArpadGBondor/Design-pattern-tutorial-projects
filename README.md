The blog, and the videos are not belong to me. 
I just wanted to create the example projects myself, to understand design patterns better.

# Design patterns
A pattern is a way to describe a tested, proven solution or approach to a common design problem.
## 1. Creational patterns
### 1.1. Builder
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
### 1.2. Factory
Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses 
### 1.3. Prototype
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.
### 1.4. Singleton
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## 2. Structural patterns
### 2.1 Adapter/Wrapper/Translator
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.
### 2.2. Bridge
### 2.3. Composite
### 2.4. Decorator
### 2.5. Facade
### 2.6. Flyweight
### 2.7. Proxy
## 3. Behaviour patterns
### 3.1. Chain of responsibility
### 3.2. Command
### 3.3. Interpreter
### 3.4. Iterator
### 3.5. Mediator
### 3.6. Memento
### 3.7. Observer
### 3.8. State
### 3.9. Strategy
### 3.10. Template method
### 3.11. Visitor
